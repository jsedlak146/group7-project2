# 90 Days of Quitting Smoking

## Description

For our project, we decided to create an online app to help the user quit smoking.  Utilizing front-end and back-end technologies through MVC structure, the app includes many features.  Users can create a quit plan without logging in, or they can create an account and utilize our daily form features and charts to help track their quitting journey. They can also view reviews, user stories and some facts about smoking, including benefits of quitting.

## Usage

To use the site, please click on any of the nav bar sections to view the homepage, user stories, log into your profile or view information about smoking and quitting smoking.  If you choose to log in or create a profile, simply enter your email, username and password.  Once logged in, you will be presented with a chart that corresponds to your quitting information, and a daily form that you can fill out and submit to help you track progress on your quitting journey.

## User Story

As a user
I want to be able to create an account to aid my quitting smoking, and track progress 
And when I enter my daily quitting information
I will be able to see my progress graphically, save my old journal entries and read stories from other users.
